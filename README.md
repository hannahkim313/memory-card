# Memory Card Game

## Project Summary

This project exercise, created by The Odin Project, is a simple memory card game to practice working with hooks to manage state and side effects while fetching and using data from an API.

## Features Overview

### How to play

This is a simple memory card game that tests your ability to remember and select different cards each round. To play, click on a card that has not been selected yet. If your memory serves you right, the cards will shuffle and you get to play again. If you select a previously selected card, the game ends!
